# System Restore in Windows
One of the more useful tools


Good first step when fixing a major problem

Lets you “undo” the last major change to windows

Takes you back to the point of last save

Simple to do

Easiest and early step in troubleshooting

Windows System Restore utility will not affect your 
non-system files like documents, music, video, emails, etc.

## Restore Point
A restore point is the name given to the collection of important system files stored by System Restore on a given date and time
The amount of space that restore points can take up is limited
Recommend keeping 10 percent of your hard drive space free at all times

**Using System Restore will not restore documents, music, emails, or personal files of any kind**

Restore points are automatically created

A restore point is created automatically before:

a program is installed, assuming the program's installer tool is compliant with System Restore.
an update is installed via Windows Update.
an update to a driver.
executing a System Restore, which allows for undoing the restore.


> To summarize, system restore means to revert back to the point of your last save. Like when you respawn in a game and pop up at the last checkpoint. Without your recently acquired gear though. You will lose your personal files, images,etc. but it should allow you to correct the OS and change back to the previous settings when there seems to be an issue. 


## Things I want to know more about
Would it be smart to back up everything on a usb before doing this since it does not restore personal files?
