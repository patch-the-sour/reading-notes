# Dev Tools
## GitHub
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.
Core languages for GitHub features include C, C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, Scala, and TypeScript. 
Your personal account can own resources such as repositories, packages, and projects.
 Any time you take any action on GitHub.com, such as creating an issue or reviewing a pull request, the action is attributed to your personal account.
GitHub hosts Git repositories and provides developers with tools to ship better code through command line features, issues (threaded discussions), pull requests, code review, or the use of a collection of free and for-purchase apps in the GitHub Marketplace.

Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control.
