# How to remove malware from your Windows PC

## Beware the signs of a PC plagued by malware: slower-than-usual performance, a sudden spate of pop-ups, and other anomalous issues.


### Step 1: Enter Safe Mode

Disconnect your PC from the internet, and don’t use it until you’re ready to clean your PC.

Prevents the malware from spreading and/or leaking your private data.

Boot your PC into Microsoft’s Safe Mode

can make removing the nefarious files easier since they’re not actually running or active. 

only the minimum required programs and services are loaded

To boot into Windows Safe Mode, 

first click the Start button in Windows 10 and select the Power button as if you were going to reboot, but don’t click anything. 

Next hold down the Shift key and click Reboot. When the full-screen menu appears, select Troubleshooting, then Advanced Options, then Startup Settings. 

On the next window click the Restart button and wait for the next screen to appear (just stick with us here, we know this is long). 

Next you will see a menu with numbered startup options; select number 4, which is Safe Mode. 

Note that if you want to connect to any online scanners you’ll need to select option 5, which is Safe Mode with Networking. 

### Step 2: Delete temporary files

There are two types of antivirus programs.

You should have only one real-time antivirus program installed at a time, but you can have many on-demand scanners installed to run scans with multiple programs, thereby ensuring that if one program misses something a different one might find it.


### Step 4: Run a scan with Malwarebytes

After downloading Malwarebytes, run the setup file and follow the wizard to install the program.

Once the program opens, it will automatically activate a trial of the paid version that enables real-time scanning.

To run a scan, switch from the Dashboard tab to the Scan tab. 

Keep the default scan option (“Threat Scan”) selected and click the Start Scan button. 

It should check for updates before it runs the scan, but make sure that happens before you proceed.

Though it offers a custom-scan option, Malwarebytes recommends that you perform the threat scan first, as that scan usually finds all of the infections anyway

Depending on your computer, the quick scan can take anywhere from 5 to 20 minutes, whereas a custom scan might take 30 to 60 minutes or more

If Malwarebytes automatically disappears after it begins scanning and won’t reopen, you probably have a rootkit or other deep infection that automatically kills scanners to prevent them from removing it. 

Once the scan is complete, Malwarebytes will show you the results. 

If the software gives your system a clean bill of health but you still think that your system has acquired some malware, consider running a custom scan with Malwarebytes and trying the other scanners mentioned earlier.

If Malwarebytes does find infections, it’ll show you what they are when the scan is complete. 

Click the Remove Selected button in the lower left to get rid of the specified infections.


### Step 5: Fix your web browser

Malware infections can damage Windows system files and other settings. 

One common malware trait is to modify your web browser’s homepage to reinfect the PC, display advertisements, prevent browsing, and generally annoy you.

Before launching your web browser, check your homepage and connection settings. 

Simply go to the settings window of your browser to check your homepage setting.


### Step 6: Recover your files if Windows is corrupt

Before wiping your hard drive, copy all of your files to an external USB or flash drive. If you check your email with a client program (such as Outlook or Windows Mail), make sure you export your settings and messages to save them. 

You should also back up your device drivers with a utility such as Double Driver, in case you don’t have the driver discs anymore or don’t want to download them all again. Remember, you can’t save installed programs. 

Instead, you’ll have to reinstall the programs from discs or redownload them.

If Windows won’t start or work well enough to permit you to back up your files, you may create and use a Live CD, such as Hiren’s BootCD (HBCD), to access your files.

Once you have backed up everything, reinstall Windows either from the disc that came with your PC, by downloading the installation image from Microsoft, or by using your PC’s factory restore option, if it has one


### 7: Keep your PC clean

Always make sure that you have a real-time antivirus program running on your PC, and make sure this program is always up-to-date.

In addition to installing traditional antivirus software, you might consider using the free OpenDNS service to help block dangerous sites. 

Keep Windows, other Microsoft software, and Adobe products up-to-date. 

Make sure that you have Windows Update turned on and enabled to download and install updates automatically. 

If you’re not comfortable with this, set Windows to download the updates but let you choose when to install them.
