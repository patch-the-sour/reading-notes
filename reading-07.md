PowerShell vs other languages
What is PowerShell?
 PowerShell is a command-line shell interface made by Microsoft that enables system administrators and power users to manage computers from the command line. 
PowerShell is also a scripting language, built on .NET which can be used for automating administrative tasks and configuration management.
JavaScript
A client side scripting language used to add interactive behavior to web pages. Typically paired with Javascript frameworks to build web and mobile apps.
Java
A programming language used to create applications (android, server, web) as well as various software tools.
Python
A general purpose programming language that can create desktop GUI Applications, websites, web applications, as well as carry out a wide array of automation tasks.
C#
A general purpose language designed for developing applications. Often used for Windows desktop applications and games. Also used for web applications as well as mobile development.
Ruby
A general purpose language typically combined with Rails (a development tool with a focus of RESTful application design). Rails is one of the most popular web development frameworks today. Ruby by itself is a very flexible language used to rapidly build applications.



 
Who uses PowerShell?
Another way to contrast is by job title. The above mentioned languages typically carry role titles such as:
Developer
Full Stack Developer
Front End Developer
Web Developer
Software Developer
Application Developer
PowerShell is typically leveraged with jobs titles such as:
Systems Administrator
Network Administrator
Systems Engineer
Site Reliability Engineer
Systems Development Engineer
Cloud Architect
Systems Architect
What’s in a Shell?
Systems and Network Admins/Engineers will often gravitate towards a particular operating system, Linux or Windows. This may be based on personal preference, or because the environment they work in leverages one over the other. The following scenario typically unfolds as a result:
Linux → Bash → Python
Windows → PowerShell → C#
