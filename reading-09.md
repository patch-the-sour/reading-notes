# What is a SOP
  A standard operating procedure (SOP) is a procedure that is specific to your company or organization that describes the activities necessary to complete a particular task. 
the SOP is one of three types of documents that should be in an SOP manual:
Policy. 

Answers “Why?” Provides broad, overarching guidance.
SOP. Answers “What, when, and why.” What needs to be done, when does it need to be done, and why is it being done. There may be multiple SOPs that support a specific policy.
Work Instructions. 

Answers “How.” A work instruction (WI) provides the step-by-step directions for accomplishing a particular task. There may be multiple sets of work instructions that support a specific SOP.
 
## Why Are SOPs So Important?
SOPs are a primary way to implement or enforce a policy. Policies are intended to steer an organization to achieve the mission, vision, and goals of an organization, but without SOPs, are not actionable. 
SOPs also encourage consistency in execution, which is critical for demonstrating compliance with or achievement of targets described in a service level agreement.

 
## Challenges in Writing SOPs
SOPs must be: 

Readable. This means legible font sizes, numbered pages, titles, numbered paragraph headings, and effective use of whitespace.

Consumable. Using a template or predefined format makes the content easy to read.

Understandable. To be effective, SOPs must be focused and to the point, using relevant, but simple terms.

Actionable. SOPs must clearly and succinctly describe what is to be done.

Measurable. The activities described within an SOP must be specific and measurable.

## Five Guiding Principles
Keep it simple. Keep in mind that especially at the Service Desk, the SOP is likely to be referenced while handling a customer contact. The SOP should augment and reinforce training; it is not a substitute for training.

SOPs must be portable. Even if an underpinning application or tool is changed, the “what, when, and why” generally will not. This is why I use work instructions to map the SOP to the underpinning tool.

Flowcharts and diagrams tell a story. People learn and interpret information in different ways. Some people like to read about how something should be done, others like to see “the big picture” and then read the details. Having a flowchart or diagrams (as appropriate) is a great way to quickly communicate what activities are addressed within the SOP.

Consistency counts. Develop and use a consistent format or template to help make the SOP consumable.

It’s about the audience. However you write your SOPs, keep in mind that you’re writing them for your audience. If the SOP does not work for your audience, your SOP doesn’t work. Conduct regular periodic reviews of SOPs with the people that use them to identify and incorporate improvements.
