# Data Restoration, Startup Repair, and Secure Disposal

## How do I know if my SSD is failing?

Bad blocks. All storage forms are vulnerable to flawed memory. In an SSD, this takes the form of “bad blocks”—storage segments that, through memory corruption or physical damage, impede data storage and retrieval functions.

File system repair. If a computer or file system requires repair but physical defect software shows no damage, this could indicate an issue with the connector port. Before taking any action, back up integral files. 

Crashing. If a computer crashes while booting up but seems to work normally after several reboots, the SSD is probably failing. 

Read-only mode. While somewhat less common, it is possible for SSDs to cease functioning except in read-only mode. 

How do you fix a failed SSD? 

Formatting the drive and redownloading the operating system.

Power cycling the SSD. If the SSD drive becomes corrupted through power failure, this method may be the solution. First, unplug the SATA data cable, but leave the power cable in. Leave the power on for half an hour, then turn it off for 30 seconds. Turn the power back on again for another half hour. Finally, turn it off for another 30 seconds. Turn the power back on and reconnect the data cable. If power cycling has been effective, the SSD will be back up at this point.

Idling in the boot menu. This method is similar to power cycling, except that while the power is on during the half-hour intervals, the computer should be left to idle in the boot menu. On a PC, boot into BIOS and sit at the BIOS screen. On a Mac, get to the boot menu by turning on the computer while holding down the ALT key.

Updating SSD firmware. It’s possible that the storage drive’s firmware, which is integral to hard drive operations, has been corrupted. When firmware is bad, it can affect the drive’s ability to access, read, and write data. Run a firmware update tool to check whether the SSD has the latest version. If it doesn’t, install it and wait to see if functionality (and data access) is restored.

Updating drivers. In Windows, simply check the Device Manager, go to Disk Drives, and right-click the SSD to update the driver. After rebooting, you may be able to see the revived SSD.

## Is it possible to recover data from a failed SSD?

Many of the processes for reviving failed SSDs and evaluating poor drive performance allow SSD users to prevent complete data loss in the first place. For example, if an SSD begins operating again after a firmware update, its data is most likely completely accessible and the drive itself may be sound enough for continued use.

Many SSDs utilize TRIM, an Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) command that helps an OS know which data blocks it can clear. This function increases both the performance and service life of an SSD by expediting data writing, but it also complicates data recovery in the event of SSD corruption. TRIM, unlike traditional hard drive protocol, erases data completely upon deletion—this means the data is gone before the block has been overwritten by a new file. For this reason, SSDs that enable TRIM may lose their data forever if they fail, even if they can be brought back alive.






# How to Erase a Hard Drive Using DBAN

## Download the DBAN program. To start, you have to download DBAN.

## Save the DBAN ISO file to your computer. When you're prompted to download DBAN to your computer, be sure to save it somewhere easy for you to access. Anywhere is fine, but make a mental note as to where.As you can see in this screenshot, we saved it to the Downloads folder in a subfolder called dban, but you can choose any folder you'd like, like the Desktop.

## Burn DBAN to a disc or USB device. To use DBAN, you'll need to properly put the ISO file on a device that you can then boot from.The DBAN ISO is small enough to fit on a CD or even a flash drive. If all you have is something larger, like a DVD or BD, that's fine, too.

## Restart and boot into the DBAN disc or USB device. Insert the disc or plug in the USB device that you burned DBAN to in the previous step, and then restart your computer.You might see something like the screen below, or maybe your computer logo. Regardless, just let it do its thing. You'll know pretty quickly if something isn't right.

## Choose an option from the DBAN main menu.

DBAN is potentially just moments away from irreversibly erasing all the files on all your hard drives, so be sure to pay close attention to the instructions in this step and the following ones.

Please know that DBAN is designed to be used with your keyboard only... your mouse is useless in this program.
