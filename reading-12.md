# Virtualizing a Router with pfSense
## What Is pfSense?

pfSense is a free, customized distribution of FreeBSD that can turn an old computer into a full featured router and firewall.

pfSense is very flexible and can easily be adapted to numerous applications ranging from a home router to a firewall for a large corporate network. 

pfSense is easy to install and maintain offering a very useful web based user interface. 

pfSense includes many features that are often only found in expensive commercial routers.


## Popular Uses for pfSense

LAN/WAN Router

Internet Cafes


Wireless Hotspot (Captive Portal)

VPN Router

Firewall

DHCP / DNS Server

Wireless Access Point

Transparent Squid Proxy Server

Multi Wan Router or Load Balancer

DNS Blacklist

Port Forwarding / NAT (Network Address Translation)

## Why Use pfSense Instead of Another Router?

pfSense is fast, free, and stable offering tons of great features.

If you have an existing router that doesn't offer the features, or performance you need, pfSense is a great choice to replace it with. 

Offering complete control of the hardware you can customize your pfSense system with the components you want.


## Embedded Installation

pfSense can also be installed on several different embedded platforms such as PC-Engines, Soekris, Alix, and others.

Embedded installs are a good option if you are looking to create a small, quiet, low power appliance to run your network.
