# Cloud Virtualization with AWS

## What is Virtualization?

Virtualization is the creation of a virtual, rather than actual, version of something.

The concept of virtualization goes back to 1960s, but it was popularized by VMWare in 1999 when it was introduced to cheap Intel® hardware, which allowed anyone to virtualize a traditional computer with all its resources. 


## Virtualization and the Amazon IaaS Cloud Service Model

The Amazon IaaS cloud service model is characterized by delivering virtualized computer infrastructure in the form of a service.

### Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

Another critical part of the entire process of virtualization in Amazon EC2 is Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which is also a virtual appliance.




“As we can see, Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) would not exist without the virtualization which is right at the core of IaaS cloud model and the EC2 implementation at Amazon. Virtualization allows Amazon to run different types of virtual machines of various sizes on top of their hardware. It’s safe to say, that Amazon heavily uses virtualization through capabilities offered by Xen hypervisor and Amazon AMI. The huge bonus and advantage that comes through service-oriented architecture to a customer of EC2 virtualized services is the ability to control virtualization through a web interface, as well as to manage the entire system through API. The similar IaaS services to EC2 are public IaaS offerings such as Compute Engine from Google or Microsoft’s Azure; or on-premise products such as Eucalyptus or OpenStack.”
